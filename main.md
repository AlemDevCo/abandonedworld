**Overview** 
> Abandoned World is a first-person exploration game focused on abandoned buildings. Players take on the role
of urban explorers who break into forgotten locations to uncover their history, scavenge valuables,
and escape without getting caught.

The game emphasizes stealth, tension, and atmosphere rather than combat. Every decision
matters; how loud you are, where you shine your light, and how long you stay inside.
Disclaimer: This game does not promote real-life urban exploration or trespassing.

**What Is Urbex?**
> Urban exploration (“urbex”) is the act of exploring abandoned or restricted buildings. These
locations often contain forgotten objects, documents, and stories left behind.
In Abandoned World, players experience this through gameplay that focuses on discovery, risk, and
environmental storytelling.

⸻

**Core Gameplay**

Each run follows a simple but tense loop:
1. Choose a building to explore
2. Enter without attracting attention
3. Search for valuables and lore
4. Avoid detection and danger
5. Escape to secure rewards
Staying longer increases rewards.. but also increases risk.

⸻

**Risk & Detection**
> Exploring abandoned buildings is dangerous. Several factors can lead to failure:

**Noise**
> Breaking in, moving too fast, or interacting with objects too roughly creates noise that can alert
nearby NPCs.

**Light**
> Flashlights and other light sources can be seen through windows or doors, drawing unwanted
attention.

**NPC Sightings**
> Nearby residents or passersby may notice suspicious activity and report it.

**Security Systems**
> Some buildings contain cameras, alarms, or motion sensors that must be avoided or disabled using
the correct tools.

**Hostile Occupants**
> Not all buildings are empty. Some are occupied by unstable or hostile individuals who will chase or
capture players if discovered.
Failure results in being caught, forced to escape, or losing part of the run’s rewards.

⸻

**Rewards & Progression**
**XP**
> Players earn XP for successful explorations, escaping danger, and discovering lore.

> XP determines the player’s level and unlocks access to new tools, abilities, and more difficult
buildings.

**Copper**
> Copper wiring and scrap can be found inside buildings. It can be sold for in-game currency, but
extracting it takes time and increases risk.

**Lore**
> Each building has its own story. Notes, journals, photos, and documents reveal what the building
used to be and why it was abandoned. Completing lore entries is a major long-term goal.

⸻

**Buildings & Tools**
> Some locations are easy to access, while others require specific tools.
Early-game buildings can be entered without equipment. As players level up, they unlock tools such as (but not limited to): 

• Crowbars (remove barricades)

• Cutters (access locked wiring areas)

• Advanced flashlights and utility items

Higher-level buildings offer better rewards, more danger, and deeper stories.
